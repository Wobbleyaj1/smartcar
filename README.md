# SmartCar Project

## Overview
The SmartCar project is developed by the Mercer Engineering Smart Car Team. This project aims to create an intelligent robotic car capable of autonomous navigation, object detection, and tracking using advanced machine learning models such as YOLOv5. The system integrates various hardware components, including ultrasonic sensors and a pan-tilt camera module, to achieve real-time object tracking and obstacle avoidance.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv5 for detecting objects such as soda cans, computer mice, and people as well as allowing for training on your own dataset.
- **Object Tracking**: Tracks detected objects in real-time using a custom object tracker.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Employs ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles.
- **Pan-Tilt Camera Control**: Dynamically adjusts the camera's position to help follow objects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Initial Development Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wobbleyaj1/smartcar.git
   cd smartcar
